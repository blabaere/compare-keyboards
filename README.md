# A-priori evaluation of some ergonomic keyboards.

I want to buy an ergonomic keyboard, and after some research I narrowed down the choice to 3 of them.
- [Keyboardio - Model 01](http://shop.keyboard.io/)
- [Esrille âˆ’ NISSE](http://www.esrille.com/keyboard/)
- [ErgoDox EZ](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard#/)

Here I list some selection criteria that came to my mind, and will use them to evaluate the three keyboards.

# Price
|      /      | Price | Comments                               |
|:------------|------:|:---------------------------------------|
| Model 01    | 330$  | Everything included !                  |
| NISSE (L)   | 420$  | Must find someone to get it from Japan |
| NISSE (M)   | 475$  | Must find someone to get it from Japan |
| Ergodox     | 300$  | Shipping & wrist rest included !       |

# Thumb keys placement
|      /      | Rank | Comments                               |
|:------------|:----:|:---------------------------------------|
| Model 01    | ***  | Perfect arc, outer most key require some stretch. Palm thing may get in the way ?  |
| NISSE (L)   | ***  | Perfect arc, inner most key goes as deep as the ring finger, seems a bit strange.  |
| Ergodox     |  **  | Too far from home pos, several rows. Peope say only two keys per thumb are usable. |

Remarks: the model 01 thumbs are assigned by default to modifiers in addition to space and del, and since it has fewer keys it may be difficult to use the sides one instead.

# Other keys placement
|      /      | Rank | Comments                               |
|:------------|:----:|:---------------------------------------|
| Model 01    | ***  | Seems perfect, tears of joy: the pinkie keys are lower: it is shorter than the others!  |
| NISSE (L)   | ***  | Seems very good, but the Enter and Tab keys are no bigger than the other, strange too.  |
| Ergodox     |  **  | Seems OK |

# Keys & key caps
|      /      | Count | Comments                               |
|:------------|:-----:|:---------------------------------------|
| Model 01    |  64   | Shape matches finger, texture looks very good                 |
| NISSE (L)   |  76   | Shape seems curvy enough, texture looks good but hard to say  |
| Ergodox     |  76   | Depends on where you get it / customizable?                   |
