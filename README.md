# A-priori evaluation of some ergonomic keyboards.

I want to buy an ergonomic keyboard, and after some research I narrowed down the choice to 3 of them.
- [Keyboardio - Model 01](http://shop.keyboard.io/)
- [Esrille âˆ’ NISSE](http://www.esrille.com/keyboard/)
- [ErgoDox EZ](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard#/)

Here I list some selection criteria that came to my mind, and will use them to evaluate the three keyboards.
